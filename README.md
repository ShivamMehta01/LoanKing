>## Features
>>### Login/Signup using google oauth
- Users can login/signup using their google account.

>>### Profile Screen
- While sigining in for the first time, users are prompted to fill certain information which includes:
  - Aadhaar Card, PAN Card, Salary Slips
  - Upload Selfie or Photo
  - Bank Details, CTC

>>### CIBIL Score
- Based on the details entered, a CIBIL score is generated that ranges between [300-700]
- Logic Behind Calculation of CIBIL Score
  - The CIBIL score will depend on certain details like
    - monthly salary
    - bank balance
    - yearly CTC
    - loan requests made so far by the user
    - total amount gathered due to those loan requests
    - the user's age.
  - The Function used for calculation is

```
public int calCibilScore(int salary,int bankBalance,int ctc,int loanAmtReqSoFar,int loanFreq,String dob) {
        double d=(((0.2)(12*salary+bankBalance)+(0.8)(ctc-12*salary))-2*loanAmtReqSoFar)/(ctc);
        int cibilScore=(int)((700-300+1)*d)+300;

        cibilScore-=10*loanFreq;

        int age=calAge(dob);
        if(age<18)
            cibilScore=300;
        else if(age<=25)
            cibilScore+=5;
        else if(age<=45)
            cibilScore+=10;
        else if(age<=60)
            cibilScore+=5;
        if(cibilScore<300)
            cibilScore=300;
        else if(cibilScore>700)
            cibilScore=700;
        return cibilScore;
    }
```
  - Explanation of the function used
    - The user will tend to pay most of the loan from his assets i.e. from (CTC-12*salary)
    - The user will not be able to re-pay much of the loan from his base salary
    - Considering these two point, let us assume he pays 80% of the loan amount from his assets and only 20% from his base salary
    - Further the user's bank balance will help him to pay the loan amount 
    - The function also considers a worse case scenario where the user has to pay double the loan amount
    - Finally this value is divided by the total yearly CTC of the user
    - This generated a double number between 0 and 1 which is then normalised to values between 300 and 700;
    - As the user applies for more and more loans, his credit worhtness is decreasing, hence his CIBIL score should decrease
    - This is done by decreasing the CIBIL score by 10*loanFrequency
    - Finally a user's credit worthness also depends on his age, which is handled by the easy logic mentioned in the function

>>### Apply For a Personal Loan
 - The application provides a seperate acivity/screen for applying for a personal loan 
 - Loan amount to be applied canâ€™t exceed maximum loan amount for which the user is eligible (As calculated by CIBIL score)
 - While applying for loan the user has to fill the following details :
   - Loan Amount Required (in Rs)
   - Tenure (in months)
   - Interest Rate (in %)

>>### User Options
 - Users can see a loan request generated by others and will have the following options:
   - Accept/Reject loan request - If the user accepts or rejects the loan request then this loan request will
disappear from the activity/screen of other users and whoever has applied for the loan will receive a status
change to loan approved or rejected.
   - Modify loan request - The user will get 2 options to modify the loan request : By tenure and By interest
rate. When the user modifies and submits the loan request then the updated loan request will be
shown to the person who has applied for the loan.
   - The person who has applied for a loan will see multiple modified requests from different users and the
person can accept the loan offer from any of them. If a person accepts the loan offer from one user
then the loan request will disappear from all the other users' activity/screen.

>>### Mail Support
 - An e-mail will be sent for all loan related operations like creating a loan request, modification in loan request and also for accepting
or rejecting the loan offer.
